### PalmPilot
Repository for coding computer control using hand pose tracking 

If you are interested in work related to building Deep Learning models to track hand pose information , see https://github.com/4di03/PalmPilotModels

### Usage

The palm detection relies on distinguishing the color of your palm, so please use this application in a background that contrasts your palm. Efforts were done using method that did not rely on color detection, but those were too slow to be feasible for real time tracking on a CPU-only device
